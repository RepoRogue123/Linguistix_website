Place your model files in this directory:

1. ann_model.pth - The PyTorch model weights file
2. feature_mean.npy - NumPy array with feature means for standardization
3. feature_std.npy - NumPy array with feature standard deviations for standardization

These files are required for the web application to make predictions.
